Python Learning notes

- Our code is translated by the interpreter/compiler in machine readable language and executes them.
 -Interpreter: Reads code line by line, and simultaneously executes the code on our machine.
 -Compiler: Reads entire code at once and then executes the code on our machine.
- Python usually uses Interpreter to run its code.

- Link to practice python: repl.it
OR 
glot.io

- Python files are always with .py extensions.
- When you give any command in python, interpreter takes it, converts it to machine readable language and sends it to CYPYTHON VM, who actually executes the command/code.
